                            that characterize their growth habits. Monopodial orchids have a
                            single, upright stem, with leaves arranged opposite each other along
                            the stem. The flower stem appears from the base of the uppermost
                            leaves. Orchids with this growth habit include the phalaenopsis and
                            vandas.</p>

                        <p><span style ="font-size: 25px"><b>T</b></span>he more common growth habit is sympodial. These orchids grow
                            horizontally, sending out new shoots from the old rhizome. Leaves and
                            flower scapes form at the top of the new shoots. Many sympodial
                            orchids form pseudobulbs, which are swollen shoots that store water
                            and nutrients to help the plant survive periods of prolonged drought.
                            Sympodial orchids include cattleya, cymbidium, oncidium and
                            dendrobium.</p>

                        <p><span style ="font-size: 25px"><b>O</b></span>rchids can also be classified by their native habitat, which gives an
                            indication of the temperature, moisture and light levels they prefer.
                            Orchids native to the humid tropics, such as phalaenopsis and
                            paphiopedilum, prefer daytime temperatures of 73° to 85°F, with 80 to
                            90 percent humidity. They are happiest in an east or southeast window
                            where the light is not too intense.</p>

                        <p><span style ="font-size: 25px"><b>W</b></span>arm-climate orchids, including cymbidiums and dendrobiums, are
                            accustomed to an average temperature of 55° to 70°F, a steady supply
                            of moisture, and good air circulation. They are generally happy in a
                            south-facing window, though they may need a little shading during high
                            summer.</p>

                            cool. They are able to tolerate a long dry season with temperatures of
                            80° or 90°F, followed by a distinct rainy season. Their need for light
                            is high, so they should be placed in a sunny, south-facing window.</p>

                            cloud forests where average temperatures are 60° to 70°F, and humidity
                            is very high. These orchids prefer filtered light that is not too
                            intense.</p>
